terminator (0.6-1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * Use new gnome-terminal gconf key to find available profiles
  * Move a few more hardcoded items to our settings array (not that it can be
    overridden yet)
  * Fix handling of exiting child processes to properly track gnome-terminal
    settings
  * Add Ctrl-Tab and Ctrl-Shift-Tab as options for switching terminals (patch
    from Kees Cook)
  * Stop using parent.show_all() when removing/adding a terminal and instead
    show the actual widgets that have been created. This prevents scrollbars
    from re-appearing after they have been hidden

terminator (0.5-1) gutsy; urgency=low

  * The terminator window is now able to resize smaller, thanks to Kees Cook
    for the fix.
  * Email addresses are now matched and opened correctly. Closes LP #139015
  * Double clicking a URL now selects the whole URL. Closes LP #129533
  * The default behaviour is now to open a single 80x24 terminal rather than
    four terminals in a maximised window. Closes LP #126219 and should force
    me to fix LP #87720
  * There are now hotkeys for switching between terminals, splitting terminals
    and closing them. Closes LP #149931 and #148622(thanks to Huanghe for 
    patches for this)
  * If there is only one terminal, closing it will not produce a quit message
