Terminator 0.2
by Chris Jones <cmsj@tenshu.net>

This is a little python script to give me lots of terminals in a single window, saving me valuable laptop screen space otherwise wasted on window decorations and not quite being able to fill the screen with terminals.

Right now it will create four terminals in a single window and they will (to some degree) mirror the settings of your default gnome-terminal profile in gconf. Eventually this will be extended and improved to offer profile selection per-terminal, configuration thereof and the ability to alter the number of terminals and save meta-profiles.

You can create more terminals by right clicking on one and choosing to split it vertically or horizontally. 0.3 will allow you to remote terminals, but you can't yet do that.

One other obvious gotcha - I am experimenting a bit with the URL matching, so at the moment you can match just the domain or the full URL. Let me know if you love/hate this.

It's quite shamelessly based on code in the vte-demo.py from the vte widget package, and on the gedit terminal plugin (which was fantastically useful).

vte-demo.py is not my code and is copyright its original author. While it does not contain any specific licensing information in it, the VTE package appears to be licenced under LGPL v2.

the gedit terminal plugin is part of the gedit-plugins package, which is licenced under GPL v2 or later.

I am thus licensing Terminator as GPL v2 only.
